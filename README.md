# GenAI_Chatbot
This is a chatbot made for the Computer Hub AI Intern Assignment: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19YNovVRoKhlvc_IQGf_qiHDKokO7xZNzX6KJaBxcP6I/edit?usp=sharing

The chatbot is built using Dialogflow CX on Google Cloud Vertex AI. It is designed to answer customer queries about a wine business based on a provided corpus of information.

**Prerequisites:** 
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the necessary permissions to create and manage Dialogflow CX api and Vertex AI resources.

**Steps for building the project:**

1] On the google cloud platform create a new project by adding all the necessary details.

2] Next, go to the Agent Builder to create our chat app, there configure all requirements.

3] Then, create a data source for our chatbot by adding our data/ documents that the bot will be trained on. Here, our corpus and the question answers sample. We need to store these data on the cloud storage in a bucket in the data store and integrate it with the app.

4] The Agent Builder will train our bot on the provided data using Dialogflow API for us, without us requiring to code it extensively.

5] After all integrations, processing, training and configurations we can preview our chatbot and make any required changes to it(even its UI) before publishing it.

**Benefits:**
- Website Integration: Our Chatbot can be easily integrated on any website by using the code generated by Vertex AI and adding it to our websites code. (This code is provided in the text file)
- Cost Optimization: Using Dialogflow's fulfillment to handle complex queries or external API calls, can help reduce costs. Monitor token usage and optimize prompts accordingly.
- Performance Optimization: Leveraging Dialogflow's caching and indexing features to improve response times and using Webhooks for computationally intensive tasks.
- Conversation History: Dialogflow CX supports context management to maintain conversation history. Using sessions and parameters to store and retrieve information across turns.

**Additionally:**
The chatbot also provided the source for its answers to the queries.

**Future Improvements:**
- Implement more sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities using Vertex AI Generative AI.
- Integrate with other Google Cloud services like BigQuery for advanced analytics.
- Add support for multiple languages.
- Enhance the chatbot's personality and conversational abilities.

### This Chatbot is an easy, fast and accurate solution for websites allowing easy deployment and cost optimization, in the era of GenAI utilizing Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Dialogflow CX.
